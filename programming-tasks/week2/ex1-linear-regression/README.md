# Steps 

# Linear regression with one variable 

* Load data 
* Split matrix into X and Y (X input variable and Y is output variable)
* Add a column of ones (it's necessary for operate between two matrix)
* Init theta (zeros) and select interations and alpha value
* Compute initial cost (Mean Squared Error)
* Run gradiant decent 
* Calcualte prediction
